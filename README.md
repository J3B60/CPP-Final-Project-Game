# C++ Final Project - Card Game Drump
The aim of this coursework was to use the skills we have learnt over the course of the module and create a card game with either a GUI or console interface.

## Drump and rules summary
Drump is a card game that uses a standard deck of 52 cards. It was created by Kazuki Takahashi for a single Manga volume (a Japanese comic). 

The rules are long but the basic idea of the game is that, you use a standard deck of 52 (without the jokers) and play with two people. You draw cards from a shared deck each turn. You have a deck pile, a shared discard pile, 4 zones for numbered cards (1-9) and 4 zones for (10, J, Q, K). You have cards that are used for attacking and defending agaist the opponent and cards that you need to collect which can be a mixture of King, Jack, Queen and 10 but must all be of different Suit. When you have one of every suit you win.

The choice to use Drump as the card game for my project is because it has not been done before so I can challenge my self to create something original. The rules are much more complicated compared to usual card games which I thought would be perfect as a challenge to program.
